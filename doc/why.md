### Why
There are two types of developers. You probably are new to React, fascinated by this state-oriented mode before becoming confused about something. **Data interaction is an issue between components**, especially for those written in different files. That's the moment when you have to embark on a treck of deeper learning and finally get beaten by myriad concepts: redux, reducer, action, dispatch, blah...

On the other hand, you probably are proficient in React and familiar with those senior concepts. There is no doubt that redux is great since it is solid and sophisticated. However, having been suffered from its inerp pattern for several times, you start to doubt **whether it is necessary to apply redux into all kinds of applications**. Let's just get rid of it before it becomes compulsory.
